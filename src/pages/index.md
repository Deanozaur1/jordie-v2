        I’m Yarden Daniel, a graphic designer based in Tel-Aviv.
        My full-time job is actually a QA engineer in a cyber-
        security company, but my dream is to open my own design
        studio one day.

        In my free time I love reading a good book, enjoying a
        show at the theatre and practicing my new sewing hobby.
        I’m constantly searching for the best cream-puffs in town.
